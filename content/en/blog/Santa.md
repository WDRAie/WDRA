With Christmas fast approaching, We have a resident Santa visit the children on Christmas Eve, with each child receiving either a:   
- Selection Box    
- Soft Toy    
## <b>Cancelled</b>   
Unfortunately due to advice we are advised that it is "ill advised" for Santa to call to houses in Whitehall and Daingean Road.
